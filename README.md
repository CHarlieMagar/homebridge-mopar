> ⚠️ **Beta Status**: Currently tested on 2022 Chrysler Pacifica. Should work with other Mopar vehicles (Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Fiat, Alfa Romeo), but additional testing is needed. Please report your results!

Control your Mopar vehicle (Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Fiat, Alfa Romeo) through HomeKit using Uconnect!

## Background

This plugin was created to replace [homebridge-uconnect](https://github.com/gyahalom/homebridge-uconnect) which stopped working due to Mopar's authentication system changes and hasn't been updated since 2022. If you're currently using that plugin, this is the modern replacement with:
- ✅ Updated authentication that works with current Mopar systems
- ✅ Automated login using Puppeteer (no manual cookie extraction)
- ✅ Fast startup with intelligent caching
- ✅ Background refresh for reliability
- ✅ Active maintenance and support

## Features

- Lock/Unlock doors
- Remote Start/Stop engine
- Horn & Lights activation
- Climate control
- Battery status monitoring
- Door sensors (contact sensors for all doors)
- Automated authentication with proactive session refresh (50 minutes + 20 hours)
- Fast startup with intelligent caching (accessories available in ~5 seconds)
- Background API refresh for maximum reliability
- Commands always succeed immediately (no waiting for re-authentication)
- Full Siri voice control integration

    }
  ]
}
```

## HomeKit Accessories

## Voice Control Examples

```
"Hey Siri, lock my car"
"Hey Siri, unlock my Pacifica"
"Hey Siri, start my Wrangler"
"Hey Siri, turn on my car climate"
"Hey Siri, is my trunk open?"
```

## How It Works

1. **Authentication:** Uses Puppeteer to automatically log into www.mopar.com and extract session cookies
2. **API Communication:** Makes authenticated requests to the Mopar API
3. **Command Execution:** Sends remote commands (lock, unlock, start, stop, etc.)
4. **Status Polling:** Polls command status until completion
5. **Proactive Session Refresh:** 
   - Refreshes session every 50 minutes (before 1-hour expiration)
   - Refreshes cookies every 20 hours (for long-term validity)
   - Commands always work immediately without waiting for re-authentication
6. **Smart Caching:** Caches vehicle data to ensure accessories load in ~5 seconds on startup

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 18.20.0
- Homebridge >= 1.8.0
- Chromium/Chrome (automatically installed with Puppeteer)
- Active Mopar.com account with remote services

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Loading

- Verify your credentials work at www.mopar.com
- Check Homebridge logs for specific errors
- Ensure your vehicle has an active remote services subscription
- Enable debug logging in plugin settings for more detailed information

### Commands Not Working

- Verify your 4-digit PIN is correct
- Check that remote commands work in the Mopar mobile app
- Look for error messages in Homebridge logs

### Puppeteer/Chromium Issues on Raspberry Pi

```bash
# Install required dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install chromium-browser chromium-codecs-ffmpeg

# Set environment variable
export PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium-browser
```

### Multiple Commands Being Sent

This plugin includes 10-second debouncing on all commands to prevent HomeKit from sending duplicate commands.

### Empty Vehicle List

- Ensure your vehicle is properly registered at www.mopar.com
- Check that you can see your vehicle in the Mopar mobile app
- Verify your account has access to remote services

## Security & Privacy

- All credentials are stored locally in your Homebridge config
- All communication uses HTTPS
- No third-party servers or proxies are involved
- Authentication runs locally using Puppeteer
- Session cookies are managed automatically and stored in memory
